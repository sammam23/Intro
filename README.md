- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sammam23
- As a seasoned security researcher, I have been involved in web application penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, and security research, collaborating with multiple websites to enhance their security and provide a safe platform for their users. I have been successful in identifying security issues and vulnerabilities, and responsibly reporting them to the relevant websites, which have acknowledged my efforts by featuring my name on their Hall of Fame, including notable companies such as Sophos, WesternUnion, Centrify, Gopro, Unilever, and cPanel. In addition to recognition, I have received swag from various websites, as well as from the world-renowned security platform, Bugcrowd. With over two years of experience working on Bugcrowd, I have amassed a vast knowledge of information security, specializing in penetration testing and utilizing my skills to assist websites in bolstering their security posture.
